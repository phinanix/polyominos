Profile before sort rewrite:
43% merge_points (of which 24% sort_unstable)
24% align_perimeter 
10% next_edge_to_cover
9% iter_perimeter
5% find_arrangement (??)
total accounted for: 91%

Profile after sort rewrite:
29% merge_points 
22% iter_perimeter
21% extract_possible_pairs (7% clone -> fix?)
8% next_edge_to_cover
5% find_arrangement (??)
1% sort_unstable (child of find_arrangement)
total accounted for: 86%

merge_points -> minus 14% 
iter perimeter -> plus 13% 
align perimeter becomes extract_possible_pairs -> minus 3%
next_edge_to_cover largely unchanged
